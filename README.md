# Landing-Page
Project for The Odin Project. WIP!

I'm building a Landing Page as part of my self-study using The Odin Project's Web Development curriculum. I am modelling it off of the
models they provide to begin, but I will be iterating on this project as I learn new technologies, make decisions regarding style, and,
most importantly, decide what the "Landing Page" will be about!

The main things I'm looking to practice with and demonstrate proficiency with are flexbox, HTML, CSS, the box model, and the ability to
see a project through to "completion".

Feel free to hit me up with suggestions, thoughts, questions or anything of that nature. I'm building in public for a reason!
