# Landing-Page
Project for The Odin Project. WIP!

I'm building a Landing Page as part of my self-study using The Odin Project's Web Development curriculum. I am modelling it off of the
models they provide to begin, but I will be iterating on this project as I learn new technologies, make decisions regarding style, and,
most importantly, decide what the "Landing Page" will be about!
